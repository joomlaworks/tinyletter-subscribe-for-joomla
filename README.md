(v2.0 - released January 9th, 2013)
***
[TinyLetter](https://www.tinyletter.com/) is an elegant, simple and free newsletter service brought to you by the folks behind MailChimp. You can sign up for a free account and start sending newsletters in just a couple of minutes.

If you are looking for a simple way to add a newsletter to your Joomla site without the bloat and complexity that usually comes with most native Joomla newsletter extensions, then TinyLetter is just the right service to use. By using the TinyLetter Subscribe module for Joomla, you can quickly integrate the TinyLetter service to your Joomla site.

### GET STARTED
1. Sign up for a free account at https://www.tinyletter.com/ - it's quick and easy. When you sign up you create a username which you can then use in the module parameters to hook up your TinyLetter account to your Joomla site.
2. Design your subscribe page: The signup form is elegant and easy to edit, so you can make TinyLetter your own.
3. Install and setup the TinyLetter Subscribe module: Once you install the TinyLetter Subscribe module, enter your TinyLetter username, set the module parameters and publish the module in some position.
4. Compose your TinyLetter: Log into your TinyLetter.com account. There aren't any templates to bother with. One click, and youâ€™re off.
5. Reply to your readers: See who reads your newsletters, and continue the discussion with those who respond.

### REQUIREMENTS
- Joomla 2.5 or 3.x
- A free TinyLetter account

### MVC TEMPLATING
The module already includes some generic CSS styling, which makes it truly 'plug and play' for your Joomla website. If you want more control, you can simply override both the generated HTML and CSS, using MVC template overrides within your Joomla template. Hover over each parameter in the module settings for additional info.
